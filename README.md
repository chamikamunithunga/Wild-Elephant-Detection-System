# Elephant Detection System in Sri Lanka

## Project Overview
The Elephant Detection System in Sri Lanka aims to identify and track elephant movements in real-time, providing a reliable and efficient solution to mitigate human-elephant conflict. Using advanced technologies like computer vision, machine learning, and AI, this system helps to monitor elephants' behavior and alert local authorities to ensure the safety of both humans and elephants.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Detect elephants in images and video feeds in real time.
- **Alert System**: Send alerts to authorities when an elephant is detected near human settlements or critical areas.
- **Tracking**: Track elephant movements and monitor their activity patterns.
- **Data Collection**: Collect data on elephant population and movement to aid conservation efforts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For training and deploying machine learning models.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Object detection model for real-time detection.
- **Django / Flask**: For creating the web interface (if applicable).
- **AWS / Azure**: Cloud services for data storage and processing (optional).
