					<h2>WHAT IS TUSKER.AI ..? </h2>
					 </div>

					 <div class="des1">
						<p>Tusker.AI could revolutionize Sri Lanka's approach to 
							mitigating human-elephant conflicts, an issue deeply intertwined with rural
							 communities' safety and agricultural productivity. Here's how the platform
							  could make a profound impact.., <br> <br> focusing on tracking and monitoring wild elephants to reduce human-elephant conflicts. By leveraging advanced computer vision and AI, the platform can analyze real-time data from cameras, drones, or satellite images to identify elephant movements and predict their paths.

							  This information could then be used to alert nearby communities, guide preventive measures, and optimize resource allocation for wildlife authorities. With its no-code AI framework, Tusker.AI allows for rapid deployment and customization of models suited for the Sri Lankan terrain and wildlife patterns, offering scalable and effective solutions for conservation efforts and human safety.
							  
							  This innovative approach aims to foster coexistence, minimize damage to both humans and wildlife, and contribute to sustainable conservation practices.</p>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>1. Advanced Monitoring and Detection</h2>
						
						<img src="images/Counting_elephants.webp" alt="">
						<img src="images/detect.jpg" alt="">
						<p>Tusker.AI can leverage drone footage, camera traps, and satellite imagery to monitor elephant movements in real time. Its computer vision capabilities can identify elephants, differentiate them from other animals, and predict their travel patterns. By combining this with AI-powered geospatial analysis, Tusker.AI could track elephant herds across diverse terrains like jungles, farmlands, and buffer zones.</p>
					 </div>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>2. Early Warning Systems</h2>
						<img src="images/warning.png" alt="">
						<img src="images/warning1.webp" alt="">
						<p>Through predictive algorithms, Tusker.AI can forecast potential hotspots where elephants may come into contact with human settlements. This information could be shared with affected communities via SMS alerts or mobile apps, enabling timely preventive measures such as deploying elephant deterrents or rerouting herd movements safely.</p>
					 </div>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>3. Data-Driven Decision-Making</h2>
						<img src="images/data.png" alt="">
						<img src="images/data1.png" alt="">
						<p>Tusker.AI can analyze historical data on human-elephant interactions, including crop raids, property damage, and fatal encounters. This insight helps wildlife authorities design more effective conservation strategies, such as identifying optimal locations for electric fences or creating migratory corridors to reduce conflict zones.</p>
					 </div>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>4. Community Integration</h2>
						<img src="images/inter.png" alt="">
						<img src="images/inter1.jpg" alt="">
						<p>Using its zero-code AI platform, Tusker.AI allows local authorities, researchers, and community members to collaborate in customizing and deploying tailored AI models. This ensures that the solutions are grounded in the unique socio-economic and ecological realities of Sri Lanka.</p>
					 </div>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>5. Ethical and Sustainable Coexistence</h2>
						<p>Unlike traditional methods of conflict mitigation, such as relocation or culling, Tusker.AI fosters sustainable coexistence. By reducing unnecessary confrontations, it safeguards both human lives and elephant populations, contributing to the long-term preservation of this iconic species.</p>
					 </div>

					 <div class="A1">
						<h2>6. Real-Time Insights for Policy and Conservation</h2>
						<img src="images/real.png" alt="">
						<img src="images/real1.png" alt="">
						<p>Tusker.AI could serve as a centralized hub for real-time conservation insights, feeding data into policy frameworks. By integrating machine learning models with government databases, researchers can address larger questions of biodiversity, land use, and climate change impacts on wildlife behavior.</p>
					 </div>

					 




					 <div class="ProposedUseCase">
						<h2>Proposed Use Case</h2>
						<ul>
							<li> ~ Live Drone Surveillance: Track elephants straying into farms.</li>
							<li> ~ Geofencing Alerts: Notify residents when elephants enter protected boundaries.</li>
							<li> ~ Behavior Analysis: Study herd movements to understand and predict migration patterns.</li>
							<li> ~ Conflict Visualization: Map high-risk zones for targeted interventions.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>The Conflict of Giants : Humans and Elephants in Sri Lanka</h1>
						<h3>"A Fragile Balance: Bridging the Divide Between Humanity and Wildlife"</h3>
						<p>Sri Lanka is home to a population of wild elephants, majestic creatures that are as integral to the island's cultural identity as they are to its ecosystem. However, the growing human-elephant conflict has cast a shadow over this peaceful coexistence. While elephants are often revered, their increasing interactions with human settlements have led to tragic consequences for both sides. Some elephants, when provoked or threatened, have tragically killed humans, while some humans retaliate, seeking revenge or to protect their crops, leading to the death of these gentle giants.  <br>  <br> This delicate balance between humans and elephants is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of agriculture, urbanization, and the encroachment on elephant habitats. As elephants venture into human-dominated spaces in search of food and water, conflicts have become increasingly common, with devastating results.</p>
						<h2>A Call for Coexistence</h2>
						<p>Efforts are underway to mitigate these conflicts through advanced solutions like Tusker.AI, which uses technology to predict elephant movements and prevent human-elephant clashes. Only by adopting strategies that prioritize safety and conservation can Sri Lanka foster a future where humans and elephants can live in harmony. <br> <br> This conflict is not just a challenge but a poignant reminder of the need for greater awareness and collaboration to preserve both human and wildlife lives in Sri Lanka.</p>

										But it is also making future of Sri Lanka's iconic elephants look precarious, with the latest figures showing a record number of deaths in 2023.</p>

									</header><p> Sri Lanka recorded at least one elephant death a day in the first quarter of 2023, nearly half of them due to human causes, putting the country on track for a record death toll from human-elephant conflict.
										Various approaches adopted since 1959 to tackle the problem have only aggravated the issue or failed to solve it, experts say.
										A national plan formulated in 2020 to mitigate the problem has not been fully implemented due to a lack of funding.
										Wildlife conservationists say that up to 70% of wild elephants could die unless effective measures are urgently adopted.</p>

										<h2>Wild Elephant Deaths in Sri Lanka</h2>
									</header><p>I believe there are multiple reasons for the increase in HEC. Unplanned alienation of land (for agricultural and other use), clearing and fragmentation of forests, increased human settlements without any planning, human encroachment (permanent or transient) into sensitive areas and political interference in conservation efforts by the Department of Wildlife (DWC) are the main issues.

										Basically less land is available for elephants, resulting in their ranging patterns getting disturbed, and bringing them more into contact with people. Studies have indicated that close to 70% of the wild elephants live outside the protected areas.</p>
